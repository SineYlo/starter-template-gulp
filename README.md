# Starter Template ‚öîÔ∏è

## üìñ A little about the template:
I like to create something of my own and the template is no exception. If you remember, I also have a formula for the responsiveness of the site, but not the essence. When creating this template, I tried to take into account various factors. It will be convenient to work with it, as with the layout of multipage sites, and single-page ones. I think that this template is suitable even for the development of an online store. You may have noticed a bunch of comments, it's not because I'm forgetting something, no, in fact it's more of a visual design. I don't really like it when the code is written solid and there is nothing else besides that. Actually, this is not the final version and the template will be constantly improved.
