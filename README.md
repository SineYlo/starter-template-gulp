# Starter Template ⚔️

## A little about the template:
I like to create something of my own and the template is no exception. If you remember, I also have a formula for the responsiveness of the site, but not the essence. When creating this template, I tried to take into account various factors. It will be convenient to work with it, as with the layout of multipage sites, and single-page ones. I think that this template is suitable even for the development of an online store. You may have noticed a bunch of comments, it's not because I'm forgetting something, no, in fact it's more of a visual design. I don't really like it when the code is written solid and there is nothing else besides that. Actually, this is not the final version and the template will be constantly improved.

## Features of the template
A similar structure can be found in many folders.
```
- folder
  - global
  - home
  - pages
```
- In the `global` folder you put files that are used on all pages.
- In the `home` folder you put files that are used only on the main page.
- In the `pages` folder you put files that are used on other pages.

This is all necessary in order to make it easier to find files that are used on a particular page.

## The order of launching the template

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Create a git repository and execute all its commands initial (THIS IS IMPORTANT! First `git init`, and only then `npm install`).
3. Then you can already write the `npm install` command or `npm i`.
4. Then go through all the folders and if you don't need some of them delete them.
5. Everything is ready, you can start making a project.

## FAQ

`Answer:` Yes, you can change the folder structure, but try to always check the paths.js file.

`Answer:` It's simple. The template has the husky package installed, which should be installed after git.
